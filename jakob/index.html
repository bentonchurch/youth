  <p>Jakob is the most interesting member of Benton Youth, as he does very random and absurd things.</p>
  <p>Such as: Trying to convert Geese and Ducks to Christianity, Pretending to be a Homeless Man, and countless others.</p>
  <p>Many people have developed theories on why Jakob is the way he is, so here are some of those listed below.</p>
  <h1>The Sugar Theory</h1>
  <p>It is possible that Jakob eats lots of sugar every day, and that might be why.</p>
  <h1>The Steel Head Theory</h1>
  <p>A less possible theory, that Jakob has a steel head. This is unproven.</p>
  <h1>The Red Food Dye Theory</h1>
  <p>Some people believe that Red Food Dye makes people crazy. If true, it could be possible that Jakob consumes Red Food Dye.</p>
  <h1>Have more Theories?</h1>
